        <p class="a">
            Digital marketing is an ever-growing part of business success. According to Statista, in February 2020,
              U.S. marketing executives were devoting a whopping 13.2% of their company’s revenue toward marketing budgets.
               The allotted budget spend was up from an average of 7% to 10% in previous years.
                The statistics website also reiterated that digital marketing continues to increase while traditional channels shrink.

            Even if a company has already invested in digital marketing in the past and present, 
            facts like these continue to emphasize the need to maintain those online efforts in the future.
             It’s an ongoing phenomenon that Jason Hennessey is well aware of.
              The CEO of and founder of digital marketing agency Hennessey Digital knows that online marketing isn’t a “set it and forget it” kind of deal.
             It requires patient and steady attention over time.

        <h2>Digital Marketing Tips From Marketing Master Jason Hennessey</h2>
        <p class="b">Truly successful digital marketing requires consistent improvement in multiple areas. 
            With that in mind, here are a few tips that Jason Hennessey has found helpful as he’s reverse-engineered the Google algorithm 
            and perpetually improves the ongoing digital marketing efforts of both his own enterprise and countless other companies.</p>
            <h3>1. Put Conversions First</h3>
            <p class="b">Convert, convert, convert. That is the golden rule of online advertising, or any marketing, really.
                 It doesn’t matter how much attention or traffic you generate if you aren’t converting it into sales or some other pre-set objective.</p>
                 <h3>2. Prioritize Continuity</h3>
                 <p class="b">Continuity is another part of digital marketing that’s easy to lose sight of — overtime.
                      When you create an initial marketing strategy, it’s easy to have everything in place.
                       Brand messages, vision, logos, and color schemes are all laid out and clearly understood.</p>
                       <h3>3. Follow the Data</h3>
                       <p class="b">Data is an important part of modern marketing. It can be particularly useful when you’re trying to improve ongoing digital marketing activity.

                        SEO is a great example of the value that data offers. As your digital marketing gains momentum, your SEO will begin to pick up speed, too.
                         When this happens, you can begin to tailor your SEO efforts to enhance your results.</p>
